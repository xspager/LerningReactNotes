# *Learning React* Notes

> [!TIP]
> This is not a TL;DR of the book, go buy and read it. You can always buy used, borrow from someone you know or from people on the internet, if you know what I mean.

This are some notes and other things while read the book Learning React (2020). The book also have it's own GitHub repository: https://github.com/moonhighway/learning-react

This includes a Docker Compose file that gives you a Node 22 development environment that shares the current directory with the container, to build and get a shell prompt:

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build -d
$ docker-compose exec web bash
# Or straight into Nodejs
$ docker-compose exec web node
```

Please note that I've been pretending to know Javascript for more than a decade and technically I know the basics of React already. Consider this as notes from someone trying to get comfortable with React.

## Chapter 1 - Welcome to React

- **Give it 5 minutes**
- "*A nice side effect of working with React is that it
can make you a stronger JavaScript developer by promoting patterns that are
readable, reusable, and testable. Sort of like a gentle, helpful brainwashing.*" ðŸ¤”
- React is "*the V in MVC*"
- React Developer tools

## Chapter 2 - JavaScript for React

- You can do math (and more) inside a template string like ```console.log(`${3*5}`)``` will print 15 (page 11)
- Calling a function declared as a function expression before their declaration will result in a type error while a regular function will be called without any problem (page 13)
- Anything can be a default value for a function including whole objects (page 14)
- Remember to put a parenthesis around an object you returning (page 16)
- Keep scope always in mind. A regular function will create a new scope, use an arrow function to solve it. But if you use the arrow function for the function on an object the `this` variable will be the global one, likely `Window`.  I struggled with something like the example before. (page 16)
- "*Compilers*" like Babel help you use the latest and greatest of Javascript syntax while staying compatible by generating more widely supported code that is equivalent to what you wrote. (page 17)
- Destructing function arguments is neat. Same syntax as the regular Destructing but in place of the arguments of the function. (page 19)
- Nested Destructing is new to me! `{foo: {bar}}` will extract the value of the nested value bar from the key foo. (page 20)
- Destructing arrays works as expected but you just leave an empty space for the values on the position you don't care. (page 20)
- The spread operator has many uses. To create a combined array. To create a temporary copy of an array to avoid mutating it. To get the reminder of an array you are destructing, like `const [a, b, ...others] = things` And to use to collect function arguments for a function that accepts an array. And for constructing objects. (page 22)
- **ECMAScript committee made fetch happen** ðŸ˜¡
- How to build a promise -> (page 26)
- The class syntax is just a syntactic sugar over the regular prototype based object model(?) (page 27)

## Chapter 3 - Functional Programming with JavaScript

- "JavaScript supports function programming because JavaScript functions are first class citizens." (page 32)
- You can even add function to an array then call them like: (page 32)
```js
const array = [
    "some text",
    123,
    "some other text",
    (a, b) => {return a + b}
];

array[3](1, 3); // 4
```
- Higher-order function take or return functions (page 33)
- *Wish I have read this book 4 years ago, I'm not even joking.*
- Functional programming is part of _declarative programming_ where you say you what should happen instead of how (page 33)
- Functional concepts
    - Immutability. Change the data by creating a copy. (page 36)
    - Pure functions. Functions that only operates on the input data. (page 38)
    - Data Transformations. Uses `map()`, `reduce()`, `filter()` and others to transform data instead of changing it. (page 40)
    - Higher-order functions. A function that receive a function as parameter or return functions. (page 47)
    - Recursion. Go back to the beginning of the line. (page 48)
    - Composition. (page 51)
